It contains monthly foot traffic information for 20,000 stores in Baltimore City, Baltimore County, and Anne Arundel County from Jan to July 2024 (NAICS=44,45,71,72, 81). 
For each store, we have the aggregate foot traffic for the month, the same-month foot traffic last year, and the rate of change. You can also find information about the number of unique visitors and their proximityâ€”whether they are from nearby or outside the county.

```{r}
foot <- rio::import("../data/baltimore_foot_traffic.dta")
