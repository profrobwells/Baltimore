We are proud to have earned our reputation as labor and delivery experts, and as a site of excellence for surgery and specialty medical care, but we've evolved with the growing needs of the community. Far more than a hospital, GBMC has designed a system of care that is accountable with you for your health from birth to the end of life. Our system includes not only Greater Baltimore Medical Center but also Gilchrist and GBMC HealthPartners.  Our 14 advanced primary care offices throughout Baltimore and Harford counties, and a location in Baltimore City, offer extended hours and are staffed seven days a week, even on holidays. GBMC's offices are open longer than any other primary care facility or urgent care center, with hours that are a reflection of our patients' real lives. You shouldn't have to take off work, lose money, or find childcare in order to see your doctor. We'll work around your schedule to deliver the care you need. On-site labs and diagnostic testing, in-office appointments with Baltimore's best specialists, and drive-through flu-shot clinics, all add to the convenience. A single electronic medical record gives you 24-hour access to all of your health information.  We use an innovative team-based approach to your care. Your personal physician is the captain of the team that includes nurse care managers, and care coordinators, behavioral specialists, psychiatrists, and addiction specialists, if you need them. The team is with you every step of the way, following up on your care plan and assuring that we keep you well or, if you already suffer from chronic disease, that you meet your health goals.  Our vision is to be the community-based healthcare system where every patient gets the care that we want for our own loved ones, every time. We want to deliver better health and better care at lower cost. And, when you need it, Gilchrist provides elder medical care, counseling, support, and hospice services."
