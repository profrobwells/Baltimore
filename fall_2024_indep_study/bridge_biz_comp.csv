The museum is home to a renowned collection of fine and decorative arts, rare books, and manuscripts assembled by two generations of Baltimore's civic-minded Garrett family (1878-1952). Though originally constructed in 1858, Evergreen was drastically expanded and altered by the Garretts to accommodate their eclectic collections, and today is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Visitors can experience the museum through guided tours that explore the Garretts, their extraordinary collections, and Evergreen's transformation from a country villa to a hub for contemporary musicians, writers, and artists. Full information on visiting the museum is available at https://museums.jhu.edu  Evergreen's historic Carriage House and grounds are available to rent for private events.
