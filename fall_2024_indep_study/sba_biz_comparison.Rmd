This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
options(scipen=999)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
library(rio)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
biz_master_list <- read.csv ("data/biz_master_list.csv") |> 
  clean_names()
sba_filtered <- read.csv ("data/sba_filtered.csv") |> 
  clean_names()
```

```{r}
#filtered by only the zips included in sba data
bridge_biz_comp <- biz_master_list |>
  filter(zip %in% c(21045, 21001, 21226, 21230, 21215, 21223, 21045, 21211, 
                    21227, 21046, 21122, 21044, 21208, 21201, 21224, 21044, 
                    21209, 21212, 21228, 21222, 21206, 21061, 21076, 21217, 
                    21224, 21210, 21215, 21214, 20794, 21216, 21218))

biz_master_list$city <- gsub(" Dundalk", "Dundalk", biz_master_list$city)

bridge_dundalk_comp <- biz_master_list |>
  filter(city == "Dundalk")
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
